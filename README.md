# IntelliTater

IntelliTater is a 100% automated way to generate tater background splash screens for IntelliJ-family IDEs.

The algorithm used is currently taliored to the 2021.x style of splashes, but it shouldn't be too hard to edit the algorithm to handle other versions.

## Getting Started

To spin up a quick development enviornment, open up this repo in Google Colab: [IntelliTater](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Arc-blroth/IntelliTater/blob/master/IntelliTater.inpynb).
